### Lesson 2
#### A question of ownership


You can create a class inside another class, so basically you could put the CriteraObject in the Object
But you need to use static for innerClass and nestedCLass for the instance type.


#### A question of quantity

One possibility static field garantize this to only be use one static.

#### A question of visibility

We are going to hide some class to improve security and modularziation.

Food brownie = new CholocateBrownie():

class ChocolateBrownie implements Food {}


Food brownie = CarCriterion() {
  
@Override
public boolean test(Car c_

};   //assignment annonymous class

#### Simplifying the syntax



#### Reviewing lambda syntax and rules


(c) -> {

   return c.color.equals("Red");

} ;


#### Lambda syntax variations part-1


private staic final Comparator<Car> gasComparator = (Car o1,Car o2) -> {

};




#### Lambda syntax variations part-2



#### The @FunctionalINterface annotation


#### Giving type to a lambda


####  Demonostrating generalization
